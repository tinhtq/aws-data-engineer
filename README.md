## üìö Learning Scenarios Overview

### Scenario 1: MySQL to Amazon Redshift
**Use Case**: Migrate transactional data from MySQL to Redshift for analytics
- **Source**: MySQL RDS instance
- **Target**: Amazon Redshift cluster
- **Migration Type**: Full load + CDC
- **Learning Focus**: Data warehouse migration patterns

### Scenario 2: Redshift Data Warehouse with ETL Pipeline
**Use Case**: Build a complete data warehouse solution with multi-source data ingestion
- **Sources**: CSV files, JSON APIs, RDS databases
- **Target**: Amazon Redshift cluster with star schema design
- **Processing**: AWS Glue ETL jobs and data cataloging
- **Learning Focus**: End-to-end data warehouse implementation, ETL processing, and analytics


## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
- Terraform installed (for Infrastructure as Code)
- Basic understanding of database concepts and SQL
- Familiarity with AWS networking (VPC, subnets, security groups)
- Python knowledge (for data processing scripts)
- Understanding of data formats (JSON, Parquet, CSV)

## üìñ AWS Data Engineering Concepts Covered

### Data Migration & Replication
1. **AWS DMS Components**: Replication instances, endpoints, migration tasks
2. **Migration Patterns**: Full load, CDC, full load + CDC
3. **Schema Conversion**: AWS SCT for heterogeneous migrations
4. **Multi-target Replication**: Fan-out patterns for analytics

### Data Storage & Management
1. **Data Lake Architecture**: S3-based storage with proper partitioning
2. **Data Warehouse Design**: Redshift cluster configuration and optimization
3. **Transactional Databases**: RDS and Aurora for OLTP workloads
4. **NoSQL Patterns**: DynamoDB design patterns and migration strategies

### Data Processing & Transformation
1. **ETL Pipelines**: AWS Glue jobs and crawlers
2. **Real-time Processing**: Kinesis Data Streams and Analytics
3. **Serverless Computing**: Lambda functions for data processing
4. **Big Data Processing**: EMR clusters for large-scale analytics

### Data Governance & Security
1. **Access Control**: IAM roles and policies for data services
2. **Encryption**: At-rest and in-transit encryption patterns
3. **Data Cataloging**: AWS Glue Data Catalog management
4. **Compliance**: Data retention and audit logging

## Common DMS Use Cases

- **Database Migration**: Move databases to AWS
- **Database Replication**: Keep databases in sync
- **Data Integration**: Combine data from multiple sources
- **Analytics Preparation**: Move transactional data to analytical systems
- **Disaster Recovery**: Maintain standby databases

## Best Practices to Implement

- Use appropriate instance classes for replication instances
- Configure proper security groups and network access
- Monitor replication lag and performance metrics
- Handle large object (LOB) data appropriately
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Test migration tasks thoroughly before production

## Getting Started

1. Choose a scenario directory
2. Review the README in that directory
3. Deploy the infrastructure using Terraform
4. Follow the step-by-step migration guide
5. Monitor the migration process
6. Clean up resources when done

## Cost Considerations

- DMS replication instances incur hourly charges
- Data transfer costs may apply
- Target database costs (RDS, Redshift, etc.)
- Always clean up resources after learning exercises

## Certification Exam Topics Covered

- Database migration planning and execution
- DMS architecture and components
- Migration task configuration
- Monitoring and troubleshooting
- Security and networking considerations
- Performance optimization techniques
